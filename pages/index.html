        <p>Born in New Jersey but call Delaware home.</p>

        <p>
          My collegiate journey took me to Newark, Delaware, and Nashville,
          Tennessee, where I earned a bachelor's degree in business. However, my
          passion for technology has now led me down a different path.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, I embarked on a self-taught coding journey, delving into
          the intricacies of programming. This newfound interest inspired me to
          enroll in a full stack development course.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I acknowledge that there's always more to learn, I thrive on the
          challenge of tackling complex problems and honing my coding skills.
          I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead as I continue to
          grow in this dynamic field.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not immersed in work or coding projects, you can find me
          staying active by working out, exploring new destinations to
          experience diverse cultures (and of course food), and spending some
          downtime outdoors.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also spend my time diving into captivating reads, looking for newly
          released music, or searching for the best lasagna the East Coast has
          to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm sure there's much more to me than what's listed here, so don't
          hesitate to reach out if you'd like to learn more.
